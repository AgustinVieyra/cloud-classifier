# Cloud classifier
A first approach in automatizing the data entry for clouds in a meteorological database using a deep learning image classifier.

As you can see from the code, it classified all the 41 validation images (the tests) correctly. The next iteration of this code should be getting more training data (which can be messier, or with more types of clouds).

The project was made with help of the documentation from Fast.ai.
