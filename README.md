# Cloud classifier
A Google Collab project as a first approach in automatizing the data entry for clouds in a meteorological database using a deep learning image classifier. It takes a picture and classifies it as either a cirrus or a cumulus cloud.

As you can see from the notebook, it classified all the 41 validation images (the tests) correctly. As ways of upgrading the next iteration of this project add ore training data and a do a k-fold cross validation to have more rigorous results. Then upgrade the model to differentiate between more classes of clouds and work with some more noisier data.

The project was made with help of the documentation from Fast.ai.
